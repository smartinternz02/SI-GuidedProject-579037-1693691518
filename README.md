# AI-Powered Real-Time Communication System for People with Disabilities

## Project Overview
Our project aims to develop a real-time communication system using Artificial Intelligence
(AI) to empower individuals who are deaf and mute. The system will leverage AI algorithms
to interpret sign language and convert it into text or speech output, facilitating seamless
communication for those with speech and hearing impairments. Through user-centered design and 
collaboration with the deaf and mute community, we seek to create an inclusive and
transformative platform that enhances their lives and fosters greater connectivity with the
world. This project represents a beacon of hope, promising innovative solutions to bridge
communication gaps and make everyday tasks more accessible for individuals of all abilities.
